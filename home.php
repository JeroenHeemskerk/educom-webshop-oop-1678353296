      <pre>
In lines of code and endless <sub>loops</sub>,
A world of logic and rules we group.
With keyboard clicks and mousepad scrolls,
We bring ideas to life, from abstract goals.

Our minds decipher lines of text,
Seeking <sup>errors</sup> that cause defects.
We build solutions, one step at a time,
Asking the computer to execute our design.

In languages foreign to the common ear,
We communicate with the machine, crystal clear.
We give commands, and it follows our lead,
Transforming our thoughts into something concrete.

Programming, a craft that builds the future,
Powering machines that bring us nurture.
It is an art, a science, a way of life,
A journey of discovery, of learning and strife.

So let us embrace the beauty of code,
And revel in its wondrous abode.
For it is the pathway to a world beyond,
One that we build with every command.
